## My process

I used beginner's skills of HTML and CSS, and worked with VScode.
I created a container, with the QR code image and the text inside.
Then I tried to replicate the expected design by styling the image and the texts.
The container is a div, the image is also a div.
The text is a h1 and a p.


## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


## What I learned

It was useful as a review of my beginners html/css coding skills.
I also learned how to create repository with Github and how to upload code. 
It's also my first readme file!
